# Hike-SwiftUI
A visually appealing simple Hike 🥾⛺🚵🧗🏞️ app developed using SwiftUI

Developed in SwiftUI, Hike features a sophisticated card layout, dynamic gradient animations, and reusable components, providing a seamless user experience. Alternate app icons, SF Symbols integration, and support for both light and dark modes have been implemented, enhancing the app's versatility and user appeal.

In this project, I have developed a creative card design for a fictional hiking app using the SwiftUI framework.
The main goal of this iOS project is to to put together different layout containers by creating a quite complex design.
But not only that, this mini-application has some amazing built-in features as well.

Overall this project is an impressive Card app with such a settings screen where users will be able to change the icon of the application.
