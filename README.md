# Hike-SwiftUI
A visually appealing simple Hike 🥾⛺🚵🧗🏞️ app developed using SwiftUI

Hiking is a fun and enjoyable outdoor activity for friends and families!

In this project, I have developed a creative card design for a fictional hiking app using the SwiftUI framework.

The main goal of this iOS project is to to put together different layout containers by creating a quite complex design.

But not only that, this mini-application has some amazing built-in features as well.

Overall this project is an impressive Card app with such a settings screen where users will be able to change the icon of the application.
